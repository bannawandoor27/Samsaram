# FastAPI-React Audio Translation App

## Introduction

This project aims to build a real-time audio translation application using FastAPI and React. The backend, built with FastAPI, provides a WebSocket endpoint to handle streaming audio data. The frontend, developed with React and managed by Vite, captures audio input and streams it to the backend. The backend service then translates the audio from any language into Malayalam and can stream the translation to another device or return it to the frontend.

## Features

- Real-time audio streaming from the React frontend to the FastAPI backend.
- Audio translation from any language to Malayalam.
- WebSocket communication for live data transfer.
- Scalable and modular project structure.
